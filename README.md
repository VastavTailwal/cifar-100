# Image Classification Project on CIFAR-100 Dataset with Transfer Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on image classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques. The goal was to classify images from the CIFAR-100 dataset, leveraging a pre-trained deep learning model and fine-tuning it for improved accuracy.

## Project Highlights

- **Dataset:** CIFAR-100 dataset, which contains 100 classes of 60,000 32x32 color images.

- **Techniques Used:**
  - Transfer Learning: Utilized a pre-trained deep learning model as the base architecture.
  - Data Preprocessing: Conducted data augmentation and normalization to enhance model generalization.
  - Fine-Tuning: Adapted the pre-trained model for the CIFAR-100 dataset.

- **Results:**
  - Training Set Accuracy: 0.51
  - Development (Dev) Set Accuracy: 0.29

## Approach

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Before model training, data normalization is performed, to prepare the dataset for better generalization.

2. **Transfer Learning:** Pre-trained deep learning model - ResNet and VGG were chosen as the base architecture. Transfer learning was applied to leverage the pre-trained model's knowledge and adapt it to the CIFAR-100 dataset.

3. **Model Training:** The adapted model was trained using Python and TensorFlow. Hyperparameters were fine-tuned to optimize performance.

4. **Evaluation:** The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy metrics. A training set accuracy of 0.51 and a dev set accuracy of 0.29 were achieved.

## Lessons Learned

- The project highlighted the challenges of achieving high accuracy on a complex dataset like CIFAR-100.
- Transfer learning proved to be a valuable technique for leveraging pre-trained models, but further optimization may be necessary for better results.

## Future Steps

- Exploring additional techniques to address overfitting and improve model generalization.
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters and conducting experiments to enhance accuracy.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable hands-on experience in image classification, deep learning, and transfer learning techniques. While the achieved accuracy may be lower than desired, the project served as a learning opportunity and a basis for further improvements in the field of deep learning.
